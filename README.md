Defining a replacement for AppleScript

(dear god I hate markdown, it'a such a fucking clown show)

	So given Apple, it has become obvious they have no interest in supporting any form of user automation that isn't 100% controlled by devs, i.e. Shortcuts. This is not to say Shortcuts are bad, they're a great paradigm for a lot of things. But if you as just a person want to do a thing Shortcuts don't allow for, you can't. It's literally impossible, again, by design. If the dev doesn't feel like, or doesn't see any value in adding the functionality you want to an application, you're shit out of luck. By design.  

	However, since it's doubtful the underlying mechanisms that allow Shortcuts to work, including the Apple Event mechanism, will go away, then there's perhaps a way to not lose what things likke AppleScript, and PowerShell on windows gives us. Yes, it would be nice if Apple were to build an OS-wide automation framework into macOS, (or i(Pad)OS, but you're more likely to get a free million dollars from Apple than see that happen. The last time that existed was Mac OS 9. Yeah, even the great STEEEEVE didn't care. So accept reality.  

	Also, I, obviously, have nothing against AppleScript. It's an amazing tool a far better language than people want it to be, whose greatest sin is not being C or JavaScript. The problem is, there's nothing that allows you to progress from AppleScript to Swift. There was, for a while, AppleScript Objective-C, ASOC, which was a great bridge, but ObjC is on the way out, so there's no bridge to get one into Swift, or SwiftUI the way ASOC did to help one move from AppleScript to ObjectiveC.

Operators 

In general, operators are APS. However, there are exceptions: 

1) No ternary conditionals. The syntax on those is obtuse for the new person, and honestly, having to type out a full if statement is not a fate worse than death. It's not even worse than stepping on a Lego. You'll be fine 
 
2) As swiffleScript has no optionals, there's no need for a nil coalescing operator 

That's really it. The range operators and logical operators in Swift are fine for swiffleScript
